# Stack Data Structure Implementation in Python

## Overview

This project implements the Stack data structure in Python. A Stack is a linear data structure which follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The last item to be added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

The Stack class in this project has the following methods:

`__init__`: Initializes an empty stack.
`is_empty`: Returns True if the stack is empty, False otherwise.
`push`: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
`pop`: Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.
`size`: Returns the number of items in the stack.
`peep`: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project, as it is written in pure Python and does not require any additional libraries or packages.

## Usage

To use this Stack implementation, simply create an instance of the Stack class, and use its methods as needed.


## Conclusion

This project provides a simple and straightforward implementation of the Stack data structure in Python. It is a good starting point for those who are new to Stacks and data structures in general, and can be used as a reference for more complex implementations.
